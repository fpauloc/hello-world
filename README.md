For now I am doing the practic of my degree course as a programmer.

I'm creating this project in Git, maybe in the future it will be useful.

Personal interests and likes, hmmm ... well we left it for later ...

now I have to continue with my java project with selenium and with the preparation for IHK exams

Also, My project is about a test automation system using Selenium IDE, Selenium Webdriver and Java.

I hope that someone have a litle bit time to give some ideas or help 

I'm new here - Github, Selenium or Java, that's why this presence here on GitHub
